# Florence
*This is the final project for Lighthouse Labs*

### Project Description

Florence improves the interaction between nurses and patients by providing patients with the assurance that their requests have been acknowledged. It also will improve nurse workflow and efficiency with the ability to see and respond to different types of requests made by the patients. Finally, the nurse admins will be able to manage nurses, care aides, and patients, as well as providing logs and analytics for documentation and potential insights into improving care.

The goal is to reduce patient uncertainty and increase nurse efficiency.
